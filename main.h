* Name: Caleb Drake
* Class: Data Structures
* Program: SimpleClasses
* Purpose: This program demonstrates how to use simple parent/child classes in C++.
*          The parent class is a book object and the child class is an ebook object inheriting properties of the book object.
*          This is the "main.h" file, which includes "ebook.h" and "functions.h" to allow "main.cpp" to call the necessary functions to run the code.
